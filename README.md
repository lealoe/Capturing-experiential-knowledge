# Capturing-experiential-knowledge
This repository provides the code to conduct the analyses described in "Capturing emerging experiential knowledge and value considerations in the COVID-19 pandemic: AIâ€™s potential for vaccination guidelines"

The code and information are provided for the following analyses: 
- Initial data preparation
- Application of sentiment and subjectivity analysis to Facebook comments.
- Rudimentary filtering of the text corpus to arrive at experiential knowledge
- Pre-processing of the data and implementation of Structral Topic Modeling

The code for the development of the machine learning classifier to identify experiential knowledge can be found here:	https://github.com/jmichellec/VU-Athena-Covid-Project 

The Facebook comments dataset used to conduct the analyses in our study is publicly available. Facebook comments are shared as comment ids and can be used to query the complete comment texts from Facebook. The existing code is developed on R version 3.6.2 and Python version 3.7.
